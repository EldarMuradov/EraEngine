# About

Era Engine is a modern ECS-based game engine that provides developers with powerful tools for creating 2D/3D games. It includes the following features and functionality:

### Entity Component System:
Era Engine uses ECS to manage game objects and their behavior. This allows developers to easily create and modify complex systems in the game.

### Rendering: 
The engine uses DirectX 12 to provide high-quality and efficient rendering, allowing you to create visually appealing games with advanced graphical effects. DLSS 3.5 and FSR 2.0 supported.

### Physics: 
Integration with PhysX 4.1 provides realistic simulation of game physics, including collisions, gravity, aggregates, joints, ragdoll, vehicles, GPU-based tasks and other physical interactions.

### User Interface: 
ImGui is integrated into the engine to create intuitive and customizable user interfaces in games. 

### Scripting: 
Era Engine uses .NET 8.0 Native AOT. This allows developers to write scripts in C# with all the benefits of .NET, including high performance and a rich class library.
